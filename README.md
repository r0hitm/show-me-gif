# ShowMeGIF

A simple web app that translates the text you type into a GIF. It uses
Giphy's API to do so.

I built this to learn about promises and async/await in JavaScript, and
therefore it's not very pretty or optimized.

Project inspired by [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis).
